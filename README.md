# TensorFlow Practice
In this repo, I explore a variety of commonly used learning algorithms such as:
  - Linear Regression
  - Classification
  - Clustering
  - Hidden Markov Models

All of these examples are based on datasets from Google's [TensorFlow Datasets](https://www.tensorflow.org/datasets/catalog/overview)
